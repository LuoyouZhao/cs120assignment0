<p>
    Hello! My name is Luoyou Zhao, and I am taking this class to expand my knowledge in web technologies. My background is in computer science, but I am unfamiliar with web programming. I am excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to enhance my skills and explore new opportunities in this area.
